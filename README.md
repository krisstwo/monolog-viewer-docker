Monolog Viewer 
==============

A viewer to nicely display log files generated by [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).

Based on the [Syonix monolog-viewer](https://github.com/Syonix/monolog-viewer) project.

Features :
- a small footprint image based on php:7.*-fpm-alpine (a full debian image is kinda too much for just a tool, think you'll have PhpMyAdmin and other aside too)
- HTTP basic auth if you specify BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD env variables to the container
- public github repo
